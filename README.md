# PythonFFC
Re learning python from freeCodeCamp

## Definitions
- Central processing unit: Runs the program - The CPU is always wondering "what to do next". Not the brains exactly - very dumb but verry fast
- Input Devices: Keyboard, Mouse, Touch screens
- Output Devices: Screen, Speakers, Printer, DVD Burner
- Main Memory: fast small temporary storage - lost on reboot - aka RAM
- Secondary Memory: Slower large permanent storage - lasts until deleted - disk  drive / memory stick

- Pythonis the language of the python interpreter and those who can converse with it. An individual who can speak Python is known as a Pythonista. It is a very uncommon skill, and may be hereditary. Nearly all known Pythonistas use software initially developed by Guido van Rossum

## Program Steps or Program Flow
- - Sequential Steps
 * x = 2
 * print(x)
 * x = x + 2
 * print(x)

- - Conditional Steps
 * x = 5
 * if x < 10:
 *      print('smaller)
 * if x > 20:
 *      print('Bigger)
 * print('finish')

- - Repeated Steps
* x = 5
* while x > 0 :
*     print (x)
*     x = x - 1
* print('BlastOff!')
